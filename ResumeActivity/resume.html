                            Built a robot with the Lions Robotics Team to navigate and map a rough terrain
                            maze with the help of a lidar. The navigation was solved using the Bellman-Ford algorithm.

                            Lead the program’s development. Part of the challenge was to detect movement
                            and classify Hazmat labels using cameras; which was done using Python and OpenCV in a
                            Raspberry Pi. The image classification algorithm involved Haar Cascades, Keypoints and
                            Template
                            matching. The robot had a total of 18 servo motors, 12 which integrated the swerve drive
                            mechanism while the rest were connected in series to form a robotic claw to reach small
                            objectives using inverse kinematics. (C++, Java, and Python).

                            with Microsoft Kinect V2 using Processing and SimpleOpenNI. The mathematical model and
                            programming involved forward and inverse kinematics, and quaternions. (Java).

                My name is Pablo César Ruíz Hernández, a current student at Tec de Monterrey. I major in
                Digital Systems and Robotics Engineering. My expected graduation date is June 2021. What I like
                the most about my major is the opportunity of exploring the math behind engineering; from
                circuits to algorithms and moving parts. I have had the chance of representing my school and my
                country in many international events, I hope that I can continue this path in what I have left at this
                school. My dream job is something where I can develop mathematics and portray them in real-life
                applications and devices. I have been training for competitive programming contests since 4 years
                ago and I expect that my team and I can have the chance to get into the regionals this year. I
                dream about going to space someday.
